 Our main function starts like this\+: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
First we create an object {\ttfamily t} of the Include\+\_\+\+Test class. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
Then we call the example member function 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
After that our little test routine ends. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
